<h1 align="center" id="title">Memory Card</h1>

<p id="description">The main goal of this project was to build a memory card game using React (especially hooks and lifecycle methods). The game consists of GIFs images on screen, in which the user must click on all images exactly once. When the user clicks on an image, the cards are all randomly redistributed. If the user clicks on the same image twice, the game ends. The user can then restart the game, with their best result being saved. This project was made using React JS and CSS modules. </p>
